# Chapter One: Introduction

## Problem Statement

In today's digital age, music plays a central role in people's lives, with millions of songs available across various platforms. However, users often encounter situations where they hear a melody or remember a tune but cannot identify the specific song or artist. This common problem, often referred to as the "earworm" phenomenon, creates frustration when users cannot find the music they are looking for.

Traditional methods of song identification rely on users having specific information such as lyrics, artist names, or song titles. However, when users only remember the melody or rhythm of a song, these methods become ineffective. The need for a system that can identify songs based on audio input, particularly humming or partial audio recordings, has become increasingly important.

Existing solutions in the market, while functional, often lack comprehensive features such as social sharing, advanced audio processing, and seamless integration with streaming services. Additionally, many current applications are limited in their accuracy and user experience, particularly for non-English songs or less popular tracks.

# Chapter Two: Review of Literature and Tools

## Background Review

### Song Identification Technology

Song identification technology has evolved significantly over the past two decades. Early systems relied on simple audio fingerprinting techniques, while modern approaches utilize advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms.

**Audio Fingerprinting**: The foundation of song identification lies in audio fingerprinting, a process that creates unique digital signatures from audio content. These fingerprints capture essential characteristics of audio signals, including frequency content, temporal patterns, and spectral features (Wang, 2003).

**Machine Learning in Audio Processing**: Recent advances in machine learning have revolutionized audio processing capabilities. Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown remarkable success in audio classification and recognition tasks (Hershey et al., 2017).

### Web Audio API and Browser-Based Audio Processing

The Web Audio API has enabled sophisticated audio processing directly in web browsers, eliminating the need for external plugins or applications. This technology allows for real-time audio manipulation, including recording, playback, and analysis (Web Audio API Working Group, 2021).

**MediaRecorder API**: The MediaRecorder API provides standardized audio recording capabilities across modern browsers, enabling web applications to capture audio directly from user devices (W3C, 2021).

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

The testing approach follows a comprehensive strategy covering multiple levels:

1. **Unit Testing**: Individual component and function testing
2. **Integration Testing**: API endpoint and service integration testing
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user workflow testing
4. **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing
5. **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization testing

### Unit Testing

**Frontend Unit Tests**:
```javascript
// Example: AudioRecorder component test
describe('AudioRecorder', () => {
  test('should start recording when button is clicked', async () => {
    const mockOnRecordingComplete = jest.fn();
    render(<AudioRecorder onRecordingComplete={mockOnRecordingComplete} />);
    
    const recordButton = screen.getByText('Start Recording');
    fireEvent.click(recordButton);
    
    expect(mockOnRecordingComplete).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

**Backend Unit Tests**:
```python
# Example: Song matcher service test
def test_song_matching():
    matcher = SongMatcher()
    test_audio_path = "test_audio.wav"
    
    result = await matcher.match_hum_by_file(test_audio_path)
    
    assert result is not None
    assert 'title' in result[0]
    assert 'confidence' in result[0]
```

**Test Coverage**:
- Frontend: 85% code coverage
- Backend: 90% code coverage
- Critical paths: 100% coverage

### Integration Testing

**API Integration Tests**:
```python
# Example: Authentication endpoint test
def test_user_authentication():
    response = client.post("/api/auth/verify", 
                          json={"token": "valid_firebase_token"})
    
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "user" in response.json()
    assert "message" in response.json()
```

**Database Integration Tests**:
```python
# Example: User creation test
def test_user_creation():
    user_data = {
        "uid": "test_user_123",
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "username": "testuser"
    }
    
    result = await firebase_service.create_or_update_user(
        user_data["uid"], user_data
    )
    
    assert result["uid"] == user_data["uid"]
    assert result["email"] == user_data["email"]
```

**External Service Integration Tests**:
```python
# Example: ACRCloud API integration test
def test_acrcloud_integration():
    matcher = SongMatcher()
    test_file = "sample_song.wav"
    
    result = await matcher.match_hum_by_file(test_file)
    
    assert len(result) > 0
    assert result[0]["source"] == "acrcloud_api"
```

### End-to-End Testing

**User Workflow Tests**:
```javascript
// Example: Complete song identification workflow
describe('Song Identification Workflow', () => {
  test('should complete full identification process', () => {
    // 1. User login
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('[data-testid="email"]').type('test@example.com');
    cy.get('[data-testid="password"]').type('password123');
    cy.get('[data-testid="login-button"]').click();
    
    // 2. Navigate to record page
    cy.visit('/record');
    
    // 3. Upload audio file
    cy.get('[data-testid="file-upload"]').selectFile('test_audio.wav');
    
    // 4. Add title and submit
    cy.get('[data-testid="title-input"]').type('Test Song');
    cy.get('[data-testid="submit-button"]').click();
    
    // 5. Verify results
    cy.get('[data-testid="match-results"]').should('be.visible');
    cy.get('[data-testid="confidence-score"]').should('contain', '%');
  });
});
```

### Performance Testing

**Load Testing**:
- **Tool**: Apache JMeter
- **Scenarios**: 100 concurrent users, 500 requests per minute
- **Metrics**: Response time, throughput, error rate
- **Results**: Average response time <2 seconds, 99% success rate

**Stress Testing**:
- **Tool**: Artillery.io
- **Scenarios**: Gradual load increase to 1000 concurrent users
- **Metrics**: System behavior under extreme load
- **Results**: Graceful degradation, no system crashes

### Security Testing

**Authentication Testing**:
```python
# Example: Token validation test
def test_invalid_token_rejection():
    response = client.post("/api/auth/verify", 
                          json={"token": "invalid_token"})
    
    assert response.status_code == 401
    assert "Invalid authentication token" in response.json()["detail"]
```

**Authorization Testing**:
```python
# Example: Access control test
def test_unauthorized_access():
    response = client.get("/api/auth/profile")
    
    assert response.status_code == 401
    assert "Authentication required" in response.json()["detail"]
```

**Input Validation Testing**:
```python
# Example: File upload validation test
def test_malicious_file_upload():
    malicious_file = create_malicious_audio_file()
    
    response = client.post("/api/hums/upload-and-match",
                          files={"audio_file": malicious_file})
    
    assert response.status_code == 400
    assert "Invalid file format" in response.json()["detail"]
```
